# Yelpie README



Live Site: https://yelpie2.herokuapp.com/
 

Yelpie is an application inspired by Yelp, an application for local business review. The site includes pages for individual businesses where users can submit a review of these businesses' products and services. This is done by using a one to five star rating system and by allowing the user to input text in the comment box.
